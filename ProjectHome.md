# Natalie Color Tools - Color Palette Manipulator/Creator/Analyzer #

This is a program dedicated to creating and manipulating and analyzing color palettes.

## Creating Palettes ##
You can create palettes in one of two ways: manually by entering the specific values of individual colors (supports RGB, CMY, CMYK, HSL, and HSV); or automatically by importing pictures (JPG,GIF, or PNG) using a wizard. There is also some drag and drop functionality, but it's a little buggy at this time.

## Exporting Palettes ##
The program currently only exports pallets to the .gpl format (as well as an xml format based on gpl know as gplx). It can also export palettes as pngs. There is support planned for all palette formats (if possible) including .ase and .pal.

## First Public Release ##
After a several weeks of work, I've decided to release the Natalie Color Tools Alpha 2.  It's still quite buggy (although I think that some of the bugs are be due to the fact that Adobe AIR is still in beta). You'll also notice that some features do not work at all.

Remember, you'll have to download and install the latest version of the Adobe Integrated Runtime AIR from [here](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air/) in order to use Natalie Color Tools.

I'm going to stop working on this version because yesterday I thought of a way to improve the user interface. So, while I'm not scrapping the code base, the next version will have a very different look and feel. It will probably be know as Natalie Color Tools Alpha 3

In case you're wondering what happened to Alpha 1, there is an internal build which I may release at a later date.

## Source Code ##
I do plan on releasing the source code eventually. I just want to make sure that it is fully commented first.
